## üìÅ Projects Included

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection (week 1)
**Domain:** Finance / Cybersecurity  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, PCA, SMOTE  
**Dataset:** Kaggle ‚Äì Credit Card Fraud Detection  

**Description:**  
Implemented a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset using classification models and dimensionality reduction.

**Highlights:**  
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality  
- Handled class imbalance with SMOTE  
- Evaluated models using precision, recall, and confusion matrix

### 2. COVID-19 Trend Prediction  (week 2)
**Domain:** Medical Science / Time-Series Analysis  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, ARIMA, Prophet, Matplotlib  
**Dataset:** COVID-19 Time Series Data (Global) ‚Äì Kaggle  

**Description:**  
Analyzed global and country-wise COVID-19 case trends over time and implemented time-series forecasting models to predict future cases.

**Highlights:**  
- Data cleaning and transformation from daily CSV files  
- Forecasted daily counts using ARIMA and/or Prophet models  
- Visualized trend lines, growth rate, and prediction intervals

### 3. Customer Segmentation for a Retail Store  (week 3)
**Domain:** Retail Analytics / Unsupervised Machine Learning  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, K-Means, PCA  
**Dataset:** Mall Customers Dataset (Kaggle)  

**Description:**  
Used K-Means clustering to segment retail customers based on demographics and spending behavior for targeted marketing.

**Highlights:**  
- Cleaned and scaled customer data  
- Determined optimal clusters using Elbow Method & Silhouette Score  
- Applied K-Means, visualized with PCA (2D & 3D plots)  
- Derived actionable marketing insights from distinct customer groups

### 4. Air Quality Clustering & Analysis (week 4)  
**Domain:** Environmental Data Science / Unsupervised Machine Learning  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, PCA, t-SNE, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering  
**Dataset:** Air Quality Data (Kaggle ‚Äì Air Quality Dataset)  

**Description:**  
Implemented unsupervised learning techniques to cluster air quality data and identify pollution patterns across regions. Focused on dimensionality reduction (PCA & t-SNE), clustering (K-Means & Hierarchical), and cluster evaluation (Silhouette Score & Davies‚ÄìBouldin Index).  

**Highlights:**  
- Preprocessed and scaled pollution indicators (PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, CO, SO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, etc.)  
- Determined optimal clusters using **Elbow Method**  
- Compared **K-Means vs Hierarchical Clustering** performance  
- Visualized clusters using PCA, t-SNE, and interactive Plotly graphs  
- Summarized clusters into interpretable groups:  
  - **Cluster 0:** High PM zones (industrial/traffic)  
  - **Cluster 1:** High NOx/NO‚ÇÇ zones (traffic-dense areas)  
  - **Cluster 2:** Cleaner zones (lower pollutant levels)
